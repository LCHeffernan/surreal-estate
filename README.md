# Surreal Estate APP
___
## Description
This is a frontend project which was bootstrapped with [create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The app renders all the properties in a database and then can be filtered by cities and a search box for keywords in the tile. It can be sorted by price, ascending or descending (note: this feature doesn't work properly due to the data in the backend API being of string type rather than number).
This app is essentially finished however I haven't had time to refactor the code or finish writing this README. Also the tests need to be sorted due to a problem that arose through an import axios statement. These will be sorted when I have completed the final group project that I am currently working on for the Manchester Codes course.
